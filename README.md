[00:00.07] You make it sound so easier
[00:03.16] I just wish I wasn't so scared (you look scared)
[00:06.37] George, buddy, there's nothing to be scared about
[00:08.76] Just remember
[00:15.26] 
[00:09.93] When you walk, take it slow
[00:14.11] Like you're going some place only you can go
[00:17.05] And when you talk, don't be loud
[00:21.54] Friends are fine but don't be part of a crowd
[00:44.04] 
[00:24.58] And don't be in a hurry
[00:27.55] Even when you're running late
[00:32.59] You should never worry
[00:35.42] George, you gotta concentrate
[00:49.92] 
[00:39.59] Put your mind to it
[00:43.43] Don't be blind to it
[00:47.08] And we can fine-tune it
[00:50.75] Just put your mind to it
[00:54.93] (Your mind)
[01:00.43] 
[00:56.57] I feel like I was doing exactly what you were doing
[00:59.47] Ah, not even close
[01:01.45] Alright George, now let's try again
[01:18.95] 
[01:03.36] When you play, have some fun
[01:07.37] Make it look like you have already won
[01:10.35] And when you dance
[01:12.96] On the bones
[01:14.82] Try to swagger like Mick Jagger of the Stones
[01:37.32] 
[01:17.69] Wait, wait, what stones?
[01:19.13] And who's Dick Jagger?
[01:30.13] 
[01:21.95] Stop apologizing (ooh)
[01:24.64] Be anything you wanna be
[01:26.78] (Anything you wanna be, anything that you wanna be)
[01:29.73] No over analyzing (ooh-ooh)
[01:32.42] Let that man inside go free
[01:45.92] 
[01:36.64] Put your mind to it
[01:40.20] Don't be blind to it
[01:43.88] And we can fine-tune it
[01:47.77] Just put your mind to it
[01:52.12] (Your mind)
[01:57.62] 
[01:54.83] It's a state of mind
[01:58.62] It's a point of view
[02:02.51] If you want that girl
[02:07.09] Make up your mind to it
[02:18.59] 
[02:14.11] Yeah, we're doing it
[02:15.43] Let go!
[02:18.17] Hey, you feeling it here, George
[02:19.35] Yeah, right in my neck
[02:30.35] 
[02:20.92] (Pu-pu-pu-pu-pu) put your mind to it
[02:26.02] Don't be blind to it
[02:29.69] Draw a line through it
[02:33.39] Just put your mind to it (put your, put your)
[02:55.89] 
[02:37.40] Just put your mind to it
[02:41.14] And your behind to it
[02:44.86] Don't be confined to it
[02:48.46] Just put your mind to it
[02:52.69] (My mind)
